how are antibodies used in	An antibody Ab also known as an immunoglobulin Ig is A large Y shaped protein produced by B cells that is used by the immune system To identify And neutralize foreign objects such as bacteria And viruses	 1 	4
how are antibodies used in	The antibody recognizes A unique part Of the foreign target called an antigen	 1 	4
how are antibodies used in	Each tip Of the Y Of an antibody contains A paratope A structure analogous To A lock that is specific for one particular epitope similarly analogous To A key on an antigen allowing these two structures To bind together with precision	 1 	4
how are antibodies used in	Using this binding mechanism an antibody can tag A microbe or an infected cell for attack by other parts Of the immune system or can neutralize its target directly for example by blocking A part Of A microbe that is essential for its invasion And survival	 1 	4
how are antibodies used in	Each antibody binds To A specific antigen an interaction similar To A lock And key	 0 	4
how are antibodies used in	The production Of antibodies is the main function Of the humoral immune system	 0 	4
how are antibodies used in	Antibodies are secreted by A type Of white blood cell called A plasma cell	 0 	4
how are antibodies used in	Antibodies can occur in two physical forms A soluble form that is secreted from the cell And A membrane bound form that is attached To the surface Of A B cell And is referred To as the B cell receptor BCR	 0 	4
how are antibodies used in	The BCR is only found on the surface Of B cells And facilitates the activation Of these cells And their subsequent differentiation into either antibody factories called plasma cells or memory B cells that will survive in the body And remember that same antigen so the B cells can respond faster upon future exposure	 0 	4
how are antibodies used in	In most cases interaction Of the B cell with A T helper cell is necessary To produce full activation Of the B cell And therefore antibody generation following antigen binding	 0 	4
how are antibodies used in	Soluble antibodies are released into the blood And tissue fluids as well as many secretions To continue To survey for invading microorganisms	 0 	4

how are antibodies used in	There are several different types Of antibody heavy chains And several different kinds Of antibodies which are grouped into different isotypes based on which heavy chain they possess	 0 	4
how are antibodies used in	Five different antibody isotypes are known in mammals which perform different roles And help direct the appropriate immune response for each different type Of foreign object they encounter	 0 	4
how are antibodies used in	Though the general structure Of all antibodies is very similar A small region at the tip Of the protein is extremely variable allowing millions Of antibodies with slightly different tip structures or antigen binding sites To exist	 0 	4
how are antibodies used in	This region is known as the hypervariable region	 0 	4
how are antibodies used in	Each Of these variants can bind To A different antigen	 0 	4
how are antibodies used in	This enormous diversity Of antibodies allows the immune system To recognize an equally wide variety Of antigens	 0 	4
how are antibodies used in	The large And diverse population Of antibodies is generated by random combinations Of A set Of gene segments that encode different antigen binding sites or paratopes followed by random mutations in this area Of the antibody gene which create further diversity	 0 	4
how are antibodies used in	Antibody genes also re organize in A process called class switching that changes the base Of the heavy chain To another creating A different isotype Of the antibody that retains the antigen specific variable region	 0 	4
how are antibodies used in	This allows A single antibody To be used by several different parts Of the immune system	 0 	4
